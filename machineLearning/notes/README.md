_Algorithm_

   - loop of all features : (life)   
		* light -> plant -> size  
		*       -> animal -> selfconsiousness  
	- select best attribute (photo synthesis)
	- Assign A as decision attribue for node (light)
	- Each value of attribute create a descendent of node (plants, animals)
	- sort training data to leaves 
	- iterate till all data is sorted into leaves
