Fear and Confidence:

Fear comes from mistakes, we are not perfect. Not meant to be, yet we should try for perfection and forget our mistakes. Like a father loves his new born daughters kicks we should love our imperfections, like a cocoon from which we later learn and become a butterfly. Be compassionate to yourself. 

Mistakes come from not being attentive, not putting time or focus  into thinking, or suffered enough pain to gain knowledge and achieve goals. Or doing something you dislike. Or not having enough money.

Money can also effect us badly, debt or asking for someone else money takes life away from you, for this we need to save and Invest wisely for future like a ant does slowly and diligently doing it daily. Raise more weight than you can take, push your self that way you can lift more weight next day. That is how anybody can die rich. 

Confidence come from repeating the same things again and again till you can do it in your head. Once confidence is gained in one field you know how to gain in any. Slowly working hard and doing the same thing give you confidence.

Grief and Happiness:

Grief: comes from running away from truth. Accept truth, if it is your fault covey your sadness and sorryness and let the incident go. If it is not your fault let it go, like you like others can also do mistakes, we are just a sum of event + habits + parents +envirorment +dna +mind wiring + choices. The only part we choose is choices, we cant change previous one's, only ones we can change is current choices.


Happiness is of two types

1) Sensory happiness
        -   5 senses and Mind is also a sensory (imagination and dreams)
2) Happiness that comes from deep within 
- For to attain this silence is important,
A thought will come sad , happy look at it and do not judge and do not indulge.
If grief is too hard just see what you are seeing without commentary remember, things that which cause grief are 20% remaining 80% is caused by our commentary and reiterating things. Once you accept that it happend, and be compassionate to the one who caused it whether you are others, for his actions were caused in emotion, bad habit, bad raising, bad wiring of his/her head or just a bad day. Let it go, peace and happiness lies in enjoying this moment.

Concentrate on what you are doing do the one thing with whole heartedly,
first it will be hard, you will get distracted just gently come back.
Some times we forget its ok come back, donot offer treat nor criticism for sitting silently. Should be done jently, it is naturally to us, it is how we are.

 Remember how we were very happy when we are kids that we are so focused on single thing. Yes we were sad, but that is because we dint know what hunger is what itch is and what diapers are. 

Now we all know that, if we concentrate just one thing which is in front of you give it all you will be happy again. Give it your hundred percent, you will be like a lotus in water, meaning you can enjoy all the pleasures, but you wont be effected by it if some one takes away something from you.

 slowly divert your thought to silence (or breathing). Enjoy the slow breath and this moment slowly u can do this for more time. 

Donot force just try for 5 min every day, sit calmly enjoy the sweet smell loose your beautiful face, relax your body. Imagine what you want to eat, imagine how the sun hitting your body on a cold warm day. Imagine simple things in life which makes you happy. 

Now take few deep smooth velvet breaths, see how beautiful this is. Just keep doing that what ever thought follows it, its ok we are what situations made us, because of them now you are looking inside and searching happiness inside. 

This is life, either good or bad things ultimately people has to look inside. Instead of 50 or 60 when you are bored, starting at this age will take stress out of your life. 

This brings more quality time, instead of running away from thoughts.


If you are still not able to un think about the incident, 
You can dive into the incident, take a big paper write it down who what how and under what conditions in a big map. 
Answer the question
whose mistake is it yours or other ?

give unconditional love for the suffering whether it is you or other, like write down what are the best things you know about them. Good things you have done, good things that happend to you, good people you have. 

And most importantly your future goals, if you have all money and all time in your life what will you do to others, write that down and make that your goal for life. Save enough money in bank that you don't need to work, that way you can retire in next 10 years and start doing what you like completely. 

Warm love,
A Friend
