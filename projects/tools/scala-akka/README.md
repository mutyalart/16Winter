### Scala Akka Reference guide

## Scala Advantages 
One of the ideas of functional style of programming is that methods should not have side effects. A method's only act should be to compute and return a value. Some benefits gained when you take this approach arethat methods become less entangled, and therefore more reliable and reusable.Another benefit (in a statically typed language) is that everything that goes into and out of a methodis checked by a type checker, so logic errors are more likely to manifest themselvesas type errors.Applying this functional philosophy to the world of objects means makingobjects immutable.
