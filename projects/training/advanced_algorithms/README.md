1  AI : ability to take inputs and perform actions on world
	- chat bot

2  PREDICTIVE analytics: https://www.safaribooksonline.com/oriole/probabilistic-data-structures-in-python
	- faster big data statistical computationi
	- predictive analytics is often about scoring, ranking, and making predictions about future data items and trends
	- Predictive analytics is about creating models that, given some information, can respond quickly and efficiently with useful output that predicts some future behavior

3  Machine learning:
	- classifaction
	- regression
		- linear 
		- non linear
	- supervised
		- neural nets
		- decision trees
		- svm

real world algorithms, instead of searching for optimal solutions heuristic algorithms help in finding the near optimal solutions. 
- based on  common sense logic
- experience
- space and time constraints

Examples:

1 Pattern database: storing the possible solutions of a function in a database
