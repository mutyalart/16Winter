Proper use of D3.js with Angular directives 
What would be “the Angular way” of integrating D3? I propose the following: 
1) All your D3 logic and presentation must be contained within a directive 
2) Use HTML-declarative syntax to feed of data to your directive instances 
3) By doing that, you can store the data in your controller, passing it to your D3 directive via two-way data binding of parameters
